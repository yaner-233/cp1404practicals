# CP1404 Practical Projects Collection  

## About This Repository  
This repository houses all practical project code completed as part of the CP5632 course. It covers core programming tasks including class design, file handling, user interaction, and data processing. Each project adheres to coding standards and design principles, aiming to strengthen Python programming skills and software development mindset through hands-on practice.  


## About the Author  
- **Name**: Jingyi ma  
- **Course**: CP5632 Programming II 
- **Objective**: Master Python programming paradigms, develop skills in writing clear and maintainable code, and understand foundational software engineering design principles.  


## Key Lessons Learned About "Clean Code"  
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Every function, class, or module should handle one specific task. For example, in the project management program, "loading data," "saving data," and "displaying data" are separated into distinct functions—this makes code easier to debug and extend.  
- **Meaningful Naming & Comments**: Variable, function, and class names should directly reflect their purpose. Comments should explain "why" rather than "what"; clear naming reduces reliance on comments, making code self-documenting.  
- **Consistency & Simplicity**: Maintain consistent coding style (indentation, naming conventions, blank lines) and avoid redundant logic. For instance, using list comprehensions to simplify loops or flag variables to replace repetitive condition checks improves readability and reduces errors.
